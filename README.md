# Gabriel_Vending-Machine-Internal-Assessment
This is my Vending Machine Internal Assessment task I created for my computer science class in the end of 2019.

The only three files required to run this program is "VM_3.py", "Tk_bg.png" and "VM_Database.csv".
Make sure all these files are in the same folder on your computer.

To run, run the command prompt "python3 VM_3.py" in your computer's terminal.
